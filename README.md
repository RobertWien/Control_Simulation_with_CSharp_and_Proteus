🌐 SIMULATION CONTROLLING EMBEDDED SYSTEM WITH PROTEUS, C# AND ARDUINO
This project aims to simulate controlling a Embedded System with Proteus, C# and Arduino. Proteus is used for design system with virtual device such as lights, Micro-Controller, LCD, …The controlling Interface developed with C# and used virtual COM in Desktop to send and receive data via protocol RS232, so can control the system. The embedded code is developed in Arduino to adapt with Virtual Arduino in Proteus.
